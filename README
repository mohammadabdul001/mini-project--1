The Guessing Number Game is a classic puzzle where one player selects a number within a specific range, and another tries to guess it correctly. The guesser provides a number, and the selector offers feedback by indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. This process continues until the guesser accurately determines the chosen number. To increase difficulty, the number range can be expanded, or a limit can be imposed on the number of guesses allowed. It's a simple yet engaging game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
